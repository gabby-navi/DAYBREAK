                                                <p>Vehicles in Call of Duty: Warzone are fun, but incredibly dangerous. Throughout Verdansk there are a number of vehicles you can take your squad around in. Here’s a breakdown from safest to death-box o’clock:<br> <br>

                                                    Keep in mind that occupied vehicles show up on the map, so be aware that you are drawing attention to yourself if you're in one!<br> <br>
                                                    
                                                    Vehicles can also explode in a very deadly way with enough damage (each has different amounts of HP based on size), so keep an eye on the vehicle health meter, and consider bailing if it is flashing red.</p>

                                                <p>Warzone features two primary game modes: Battle Royale and Plunder,. It supports up to 150 players in a single match, which exceeds the typical size of 100 players seen in other battle royale titles. Some limited-time modes support 200 players.</p>
                                                <hr>
                                                <h3>Battle Royale</h3>
                                                <p>which has support for up to 150 players</p>
                                                <h3>Plunder</h3>
                                                <p>in which players try to collect $1 million in cash before the other squads. CharlieIntel noted this about the new game mode, as they were given access to Warzone ahead of the release:<br> <br>

                                                    Plunder has a 30-minute timer for players to reach $1 million in cash. When a team reaches $1 million in cash secured, an overtime phase is triggered in the mode. The team that deposited the $1 million in cash has their $1 million secured. During this overtime phase, the amount of cash you find is doubled. The team with the most cash when the time ends wins the match. <br> <br>
                                                    
                                                    If no one reaches $1 million in cash by the 30-minute mark, the team with the most money wins.</p>
                                                <h3>Solos</h3>
                                                <p>the newest mode added in Warzone. Here are the basics from the Activision Blog:<br> <br>

                                                    In Solos, you drop into Verdansk alone with Battle Royale rules. That means no squadmates, no friends – only you and a pistol with a few bullets. Think of this as Free-For-All in a traditional Call of Duty game, but on a massive scale.<br> <br>
                                                    
                                                    As you loot, complete Contracts, and survive against up to 149 other players, the circle collapse will roll in just as it does in a normal Battle Royale. The Gulag will still welcome in prisoners of the Warzone, but if you die in that 1v1 Gunfight, forget any form of redeployment – you’re out for good.<br> <br>
                                                    
                                                    The last Operator standing wins.</p>
